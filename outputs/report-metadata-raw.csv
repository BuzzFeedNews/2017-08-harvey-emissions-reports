"The preparation process was stopped once the venting was discovered and the PV was repaired. Several process modifications have been implemented which helped minimize the amount of vapors released to atmosphere. The PSV’s set point was raised, the flow rate through the existing cooler was increased and an additional cooler was installed which together has prevented additional emissions events. Furthermore, the plant is closely monitoring the tank pressure to help prevent future venting and is in the process of formulating a permanent corrective action.","While tank D-4110 was being prepared to support the production of plasticizer in the PX Unit, the tank pressurized and vented VOCs to atmosphere via a pressure safety valve (PSV) due to a faulty pressure valve (PV) and not fully utilizing an existing cooler. The PV allows vapors to exit the tank and enter the low pressure flare header for destruction and the cooler removes excessive heat from 2-ethylhexanol (2-EH) returning to the tank.

Proceed to Step 3 for flaring episodes. Step 3: For flaring episodes, 98 percent destruction efficiency is used for Calculation of VOC emissions. Products of combustion are calculated in Steps 4 and 5. Example using propane: Mass of Propane Emitted = (1 - 0.98)(5,818 lb) = 116.36 lb This calculation is repeated for each gas component and the emission rate is transferred automatically to the U/M Form. Step 4: Calculate NOx and CO Emissions from Combustion. Products of combustion, namely NOx and CO are calculated using AP-42 emission factors for flares. Specifically, the factors are taken from AP-42 Table 13.5-1, 4/15. Example calculations: NOx Factor = 0.068 lb/mmbtu CO Factor = 0.31 lb/mmbtu Lower Heat Value of Gas = 1305 btu/scf (obtained from gas analysis) Mass Emission, lb = AP-42 Factor x LHV x Flared Volume NOx Emission = 0.068 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 50.76 lb CO Emission = 0.31 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 231.41 lb Step 5: Calculate SO2 Emissions from Combustion. SO2 emissions are calculated based on the H2S concentration in the gas stream to be flared. Assumes 100 percent conversion of H2S to SO2. Western’s facilities are all in sweet gas service, therefore, H2S emissions are negligible for any assumed destruction efficiency. Example calculations: H2S Concentration = 0.5 ppm Gas Volume Flared = 572,000 scf Mass Emission =((Flared Volume)(H2S Fraction)/(H2S Ideal Gas Density))(MW SO2/MW H2S) =(572,000 scf)(.5ppm/1,000,000)/(11.14 lb/scf)((64.07lb SO2 /lb-mole)/(34.08 lb H2S /lb-mole)) = 0.05 lb SO2 = 276.19 lb",08/16/2017 6:00PM,08/17/2017 1:45AM,"FROM STANTON, TEXAS: FOLLOW I-20 WEST FOR APPROXIMATELY 5.5 MILES, THEN HEAD NORTH ON COUNTY ROAD 3001/FM829.

These responses should be addressed under the appropriate sections of the final report for the incident eg; Cause of Emissions Event, Actions Taken to Minimize Emissions, and Any Additional Information Necessary to Evaluate the Event. (1) How many reportable and recordable emissions events (including this incident) have occurred at the facility/facilities contributing emissions during this incident for the 12 month period prior to this incident? ~34 (2) What were the facility/facilities total actual operating hours during the past 12 months? 8760 (3) Identify the cause or causes of the emissions event and include all contributing factors that led to the emissions event. Discuss how the emissions event could not have been avoided by good design, maintenance, and operation practices, if applicable. Discuss any sudden breakdown of equipment or process that was beyond the owner/operator’s control, if applicable. COMPRESSOR DOWN DUE TO RIGHT HAND LUBRICATOR NO FLOW. FLARING WAS USED TO MINIMIZE EMISSIONS UNTIL PLANT COULD BE RETURNED TO MORMAL OPERATIONS.. (4) How were the air pollution control equipment or processes (if any) maintained and operated in a manner consistent with good practice for minimizing emissions and reducing the number of emissions events? Flaring was used to minimize emissions. Flares were properly operated. (5) How soon was action taken to achieve compliance once the operator knew or should have known that applicable emission limitations were being exceeded? Once the control panel shut the compressor down gas was immediately routed to the flare (6) How were the amount and duration of the unauthorized emissions and any bypass of pollution control equipment minimized? Emissions were minimized by use of a flare. The flare is the control device, functioned properly, and there was no pollution control equipment bypass. (7) What was the operational status of all emission monitoring systems at the facility/facilities during this emissions event? If any emission monitoring systems were not kept in operation during the emissions event, explain why they weren’t kept in operation. No monitoring systems are required for this site. Field gas production from this site was diverted to the flare and the flare remained ignited until the pressures dropped below the rated pressures for the equipment at this site. (8) How were the owner or operator’s actions in response to the unauthorized emissions contemporaneously documented? The TCEQ STEERS reporting system was used to provide initial notice of the event. The emission estimates were calculated by use of the gas flow rate and gas analysis.

(4) How were the air pollution control equipment or processes (if any) maintained and operated in a manner consistent with good practice for minimizing emissions and reducing the number of emissions events? Flaring was used to minimize emissions. Flares were properly operated. (5) How soon was action taken to achieve compliance once the operator knew or should have known that applicable emission limitations were being exceeded? Once the control panel shut the compressor down gas was immediately routed to the flare (6) How were the amount and duration of the unauthorized emissions and any bypass of pollution control equipment minimized? Emissions were minimized by use of a flare. The flare is the control device, functioned properly, and there was no pollution control equipment bypass. (7) What was the operational status of all emission monitoring systems at the facility/facilities during this emissions event? If any emission monitoring systems were not kept in operation during the emissions event, explain why they weren’t kept in operation. No monitoring systems are required for this site. Field gas production from this site was diverted to the flare and the flare remained ignited until the pressures dropped below the rated pressures for the equipment at this site.

All activities were performed as quick as possible allowing for safety.,"An unexpected slippage of moisture from the molecular sieve beds to the cryogenic process caused a freeze up and the need to shut down the plant to thaw the moisture. This directed inlet gas and residue gas to the EPNs C-1 Flare, Consolidator Flare and the B-Plant Flare.","MIDKIFF, REAGAN","Step 1: For each gas component, calculate Net Molecular Weight (MW): Net MW (lb/lb-mole) =Mole % of Component/100 x MW of Component Example using propane: Net MW = 8.7522/100 x 44.10 lb/lb-mole = 3.86 lb/lb-mole Step 2: Calculate the Mass of Each Gas Component Emitted Mass of Component = (Net MW of Component/Molar Volume) x Volume Emitted Molar Volume = 379.5 scf/lb-mole Volume Emitted = Recorded Data From Flow Meter Or Calculated in the Case of Pipeline Releases as Follows: Cross-Sectional Area x Length x (Pipeline Pressure + Atmospheric Pressure)/Atmospheric Pressure Example using propane and recorded data: Volume emitted = 572,000 scf Mass of Propane Emitted = (3.86 lb/lb-mole)/(379.5 scf/lb-mole) x 572,000 scf = 5,818 lb Example using propane and calculated area: Pipe Diameter,d = 12 inches Pipe Length, l = 165,470 feet Pipe Pressure, ppipe = 50 psig Atmospheric Pressure, patmos = 14.70 psia Volume = (Pi)(d2/4)(l)(( ppipe + patmos)/ patmos) = (3.141592)((12/12)^2/4))(165,470)((50 + 14.7)/14.7) = 572,000 scf Mass of Propane Emitted = (3.86 lb/lb-mole)/(379.5 scf/lb-mole) x 572,000 scf = 5,818 lb For venting episodes, this calculation is repeated for each gas component and the mass emission rate is transferred automatically to the U/M Form. Proceed to Step 3 for flaring episodes. Step 3: For flaring episodes, 98 percent destruction efficiency is used for Calculation of VOC emissions. Products of combustion are calculated in Steps 4 and 5. Example using propane: Mass of Propane Emitted = (1 - 0.98)(5,818 lb) = 116.36 lb This calculation is repeated for each gas component and the emission rate is transferred automatically to the U/M Form. Step 4: Calculate NOx and CO Emissions from Combustion. Products of combustion, namely NOx and CO are calculated using AP-42 emission factors for flares. Specifically, the factors are taken from AP-42 Table 13.5-1, 4/15. Example calculations: NOx Factor = 0.138 lb/mmbtu CO Factor = 0.2755 lb/mmbtu Lower Heat Value of Gas = 1305 btu/scf (obtained from gas analysis) Mass Emission, lb = AP-42 Factor x LHV x Flared Volume NOx Emission = 0.138 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 103.01 lb CO Emission = 0.2755 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 360.09 lb Step 5: Calculate SO2 Emissions from Combustion. SO2 emissions are calculated based on the H2S concentration in the gas stream to be flared. Assumes 100 percent conversion of H2S to SO2. Western’s facilities are all in sweet gas service, therefore, H2S emissions are negligible for any assumed destruction efficiency. Example calculations: H2S Concentration = 0.5 ppm Gas Volume Flared = 572,000 scf Mass Emission =((Flared Volume)(H2S Fraction)/(H2S Ideal Gas Density))(MW SO2/MW H2S) =(572,000 scf)(.5ppm/1,000,000)/(11.14 lb/scf)((64.07lb SO2 /lb-mole)/(34.08 lb H2S /lb-mole)) = 0.05 lb SO2 = 276.19 lb",08/22/2017 7:15AM,08/22/2017 3:40PM,FROM FM 3095 AND FM 2401 IN MIDKIFF E 4.25 MI ON FM 2401 TO PLANT ENTRANCE,RN100215714,MIDKIFF GAS PLANT,INITIAL REPORT,EMISSIONS EVENT,266018

Manually drain scrubbers.,AGI compressor shutdown on high 3rd stage scrubber level.,"FORT STOCKTON, PECOS","A representative gas analysis and a calculated flared gas volume for the event was used to calculate emissions. The unauthorized emissions did not stem from any activity or event that could have been forseen and avoided, and could not have been avoided by better design operation and maintenance practices. The air pollution control equipment and processes were maintained and operated in a manner consistent with good practice for minimizing emissions and reducing the number of emission events. The amount and duration of the unauthorized emissions were minimized by placing the AGI system back in service as soon as the 3rd stage scrubber was drained and the use of the AGI flare. The emission monitoring system (AGI flare meter) was in service during the event. Actions in response to the unauthorized emission are documented on operating and flare logs. The shutdown of the AGI due to high 3rd stage scrubber level is not a frequent or recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation or maintenance. There was no offsite impact.

(4) How were the air pollution control equipment or processes (if any) maintained and operated in a manner consistent with good practice for minimizing emissions and reducing the number of emissions events? Flaring was used to minimize emissions. Flares were properly operated. (5) How soon was action taken to achieve compliance once the operator knew or should have known that applicable emission limitations were being exceeded? Once the control panel shut the compressor down gas was immediately routed to the flare (6) How were the amount and duration of the unauthorized emissions and any bypass of pollution control equipment minimized? Emissions were minimized by use of a flare. The flare is the control device, functioned properly, and there was no pollution control equipment bypass. (7) What was the operational status of all emission monitoring systems at the facility/facilities during this emissions event? If any emission monitoring systems were not kept in operation during the emissions event, explain why they weren¿t kept in operation. No monitoring systems are required for this site. Field gas production from this site was diverted to the flare and the flare remained ignited until the pressures dropped below the rated pressures for the equipment at this site. (8) How were the owner or operator¿s actions in response to the unauthorized emissions contemporaneously documented? The TCEQ STEERS reporting system was used to provide initial notice of the event.

Proceed to Step 3 for flaring episodes. Step 3: For flaring episodes, 98 percent destruction efficiency is used for Calculation of VOC emissions. Products of combustion are calculated in Steps 4 and 5. Example using propane: Mass of Propane Emitted = (1 - 0.98)(5,818 lb) = 116.36 lb This calculation is repeated for each gas component and the emission rate is transferred automatically to the U/M Form. Step 4: Calculate NOx and CO Emissions from Combustion. Products of combustion, namely NOx and CO are calculated using AP-42 emission factors for flares. Specifically, the factors are taken from AP-42 Table 13.5-1, 4/15. Example calculations: NOx Factor = 0.068 lb/mmbtu CO Factor = 0.31 lb/mmbtu Lower Heat Value of Gas = 1305 btu/scf (obtained from gas analysis) Mass Emission, lb = AP-42 Factor x LHV x Flared Volume NOx Emission = 0.068 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 50.76 lb CO Emission = 0.31 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 231.41 lb Step 5: Calculate SO2 Emissions from Combustion. SO2 emissions are calculated based on the H2S concentration in the gas stream to be flared. Assumes 100 percent conversion of H2S to SO2. Western’s facilities are all in sweet gas service, therefore, H2S emissions are negligible for any assumed destruction efficiency.

Example calculations: NOx Factor = 0.138 lb/mmbtu CO Factor = 0.2755 lb/mmbtu Lower Heat Value of Gas = 1305 btu/scf (obtained from gas analysis) Mass Emission, lb = AP-42 Factor x LHV x Flared Volume NOx Emission = 0.138 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 103.01 lb CO Emission = 0.2755 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 360.09 lb Step 5: Calculate SO2 Emissions from Combustion. SO2 emissions are calculated based on the H2S concentration in the gas stream to be flared. Assumes 100 percent conversion of H2S to SO2. Western’s facilities are all in sweet gas service, therefore, H2S emissions are negligible for any assumed destruction efficiency. Example calculations: H2S Concentration = 0.5 ppm Gas Volume Flared = 572,000 scf Mass Emission =((Flared Volume)(H2S Fraction)/(H2S Ideal Gas Density))(MW SO2/MW H2S) =(572,000 scf)(.5ppm/1,000,000)/(11.14 lb/scf)((64.07lb SO2 /lb-mole)/(34.08 lb H2S /lb-mole)) = 0.05 lb SO2 = 276.19 lb",08/26/2017 7:21AM,08/26/2017 10:23AM,FROM FM 3095 AND FM 2401 IN MIDKIFF E 4.25 MI ON FM 2401 TO PLANT ENTRANCE,RN100215714,MIDKIFF GAS PLANT,INITIAL REPORT,EMISSIONS EVENT,266265

Until the Refinery has produced sufficient inventory for the operation of the Flare Gas Recovery Unit (“FGRU”) and the FGRU is able to provide sufficient fuel gas to combustion sources, flaring will occur from the second stage flare during the commissioning activities. The West Plant Sulfur Recovery Units (“SRU’s”) No. 2 and No. 3 will also be restarted after shutdown in preparation for Hurricane Harvey. The potential emissions from the SRU’s No. 2 and No. 3 will be associated with the bypass of the Tail Gas Treating Unit, which will result in tail gas being routed directly to the Tail Gas Incinerator (“TGI”). The dates, times, pollutants and their associated emissions given in this report are only estimates. The duration of the actual event and these details may vary significantly from this estimate. We will provide actual event details in our final report.","CORPUS CHRISTI, NUECES",Past events were used to estimate emissions for the startup flaring. Flare gas composition is based on a weighted average between normal baseline flare load and the expected worst-case flow rate into the flare system. Destruction efficiencies and flare factors are from the “July 1996 TCEQ Technical Guidance Package for Flare Sources”. Past events were used to estimate emissions for the SRU’s No 2 and No. 3. The emissions estimate is based on a flow estimate calculated from inputs into the unit and corrected for chemical reaction. This flow was used in conjunction with historical SO2 concentration data gathered by the Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) on the TGI stack to calculate SO2 emissions. All emissions included in this report are an estimate of the maximum emissions and may or may not be indicative of the actual amounts released.

During this period, maintenance activities intended for next year are being scheduled.","ANDREWS, ANDREWS","Carbon Dioxide: 30000 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.027262 {mole fraction} * 44 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} Carbon Monoxide: Decode(Sign(1738.999-1000), -1, 0.5496, 0.2755) {lb/mmBtu} * 30000 {mcf/event} * 1738.999 {Btu/scf} / 1000 {cf/mcf} Ethane: 30000 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.1695548 {mole fraction} * 30 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Hexane: 30000 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.016855 {mole fraction} * 86.2 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Hydrogen Sulfide: 30000 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.020185 {mole fraction} * 34.1 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) i-Butane: 30000 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.024738 {mole fraction} * 58.1 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) i-Pentane: 30000 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.015214 {mole fraction} * 72.15 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Methane: 30000 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.4477326 {mole fraction} * 16 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) n-Butane: 30000 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0693699 {mole fraction} * 58.12 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) n-Pentane: 30000 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.014592 {mole fraction} * 72.15 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Nitrogen Dioxide: 0.138 {lb/mmBtu} * 30000 {mcf/event} * 1738.999 {Btu/scf} / 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.05 Nitrogen Oxide: 0.138 {lb/mmBtu} * 30000 {mcf/event} * 1738.999 {Btu/scf} / 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.95 Nitrogen: 30000 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.013456 {mole fraction} * 28 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} Propane: 30000 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.1810408 {mole fraction} * 44.1 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Sulfur Dioxide: (53634.42857 {lb/event for Hydrogen Sulfide} / 34.1 {lb/lb-mole for Hydrogen Sulfide}) * 64.1 {lb/lb-mole for SO2} * 0.98 {Control Efficiency} VOC: Sum of emissions: 12442.44044 {lb/event for Propane} + 6283.29131 {lb/event for n-Butane} + 1710.68587 {lb/event for i-Pentane} + 1640.74722 {lb/event for n-Pentane} + 2239.91345 {lb/event for i-Butane} + 2264.2613 {lb/event for Hexane} Acid Gas Flare: Carbon Dioxide: 2000 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.6302096 {mole fraction} * 44 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} Carbon Monoxide: Decode(Sign(13.624-1000), -1, 0.5496, 0.2755) {lb/mmBtu} * 2000 {mcf/event} * 13.624 {Btu/scf} / 1000 {cf/mcf} Ethane: 2000 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.001598 {mole fraction} * 30 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Hexane: 2000 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.000298 {mole fraction} * 86.2 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Hydrogen Sulfide: 2000 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.3605994 {mole fraction} * 34.1 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) i-Butane: 2000 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.000318 {mole fraction} * 58.1 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) i-Pentane: 2000 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.000089 {mole fraction} * 72.15 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Methane: 2000 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.006095 {mole fraction} * 16 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) n-Butane: 2000 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.000208 {mole fraction} * 58.12 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) n-Pentane: 2000 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.000069 {mole fraction} * 72.15 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Nitrogen Dioxide: 0.138 {lb/mmBtu} * 2000 {mcf/event} * 13.624 {Btu/scf} / 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.05 Nitrogen Oxide: 0.138 {lb/mmBtu} * 2000 {mcf/e",08/30/2017 12:01AM,09/02/2017 8:01PM,FROM INTXN BROADWAY ST & US 385 IN ANDREWS GO 1.1 MI SW ON BROADWAY ST TO A FORK WITH SR 176 GO R ON SR 176 & GO 12.5 MI TO RR 181 TURN N & GO 5.1 MI ON RR 181 TO RD ON L TURN W & GO 0.5 MI TO RD ON R TURN & GO 100 YDS TO SITE ON L,RN100218684,FULLERTON GAS PLANT,INITIAL REPORT,MAINTENANCE,266427
The cryogenic process was warmed up as much as possible while still meeting residue sales specification such that as much inlet gas as possible could be processed. Inlet gas will be shut in as quickly as safely possible to reduce flared volumes.,"The Buffalo Gas Plant received a curtailment of NGL sales from 1250 barrels per hour to 520 barrels per hour of NGL product. The curtailment was received due to fractionator plants being shut down in Houston due to Hurricane Harvey. This resulted in the inability to process all the inlet gas currently being directed to the plant. This routed inlet gas to the inlet flare, FLARE-1, to protect gathering system from being over pressured.","STANTON, MARTIN","Step 1: For each gas component, calculate Net Molecular Weight (MW): Net MW (lb/lb-mole) =Mole % of Component/100 x MW of Component Example using propane: Net MW = 8.7522/100 x 44.10 lb/lb-mole = 3.86 lb/lb-mole Step 2: Calculate the Mass of Each Gas Component Emitted Mass of Component = (Net MW of Component/Molar Volume) x Volume Emitted Molar Volume = 379.5 scf/lb-mole Volume Emitted = Recorded Data From Flow Meter Or Calculated in the Case of Pipeline Releases as Follows: Cross-Sectional Area x Length x (Pipeline Pressure + Atmospheric Pressure)/Atmospheric Pressure Example using propane and recorded data: Volume emitted = 572,000 scf Mass of Propane Emitted = (3.86 lb/lb-mole)/(379.5 scf/lb-mole) x 572,000 scf = 5,818 lb Example using propane and calculated area: Pipe Diameter,d = 12 inches Pipe Length, l = 165,470 feet Pipe Pressure, ppipe = 50 psig Atmospheric Pressure, patmos = 14.70 psia Volume = (Pi)(d2/4)(l)(( ppipe + patmos)/ patmos) = (3.141592)((12/12)^2/4))(165,470)((50 + 14.7)/14.7) = 572,000 scf Mass of Propane Emitted = (3.86 lb/lb-mole)/(379.5 scf/lb-mole) x 572,000 scf = 5,818 lb For venting episodes, this calculation is repeated for each gas component and the mass emission rate is transferred automatically to the U/M Form. Proceed to Step 3 for flaring episodes. Step 3: For flaring episodes, 98 percent destruction efficiency is used for Calculation of VOC emissions. Products of combustion are calculated in Steps 4 and 5. Example using propane: Mass of Propane Emitted = (1 - 0.98)(5,818 lb) = 116.36 lb This calculation is repeated for each gas component and the emission rate is transferred automatically to the U/M Form. Step 4: Calculate NOx and CO Emissions from Combustion. Products of combustion, namely NOx and CO are calculated using AP-42 emission factors for flares. Specifically, the factors are taken from AP-42 Table 13.5-1, 4/15. Example calculations: NOx Factor = 0.068 lb/mmbtu CO Factor = 0.31 lb/mmbtu Lower Heat Value of Gas = 1305 btu/scf (obtained from gas analysis) Mass Emission, lb = AP-42 Factor x LHV x Flared Volume NOx Emission = 0.068 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 50.76 lb CO Emission = 0.31 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 231.41 lb Step 5: Calculate SO2 Emissions from Combustion. SO2 emissions are calculated based on the H2S concentration in the gas stream to be flared. Assumes 100 percent conversion of H2S to SO2. Western’s facilities are all in sweet gas service, therefore, H2S emissions are negligible for any assumed destruction efficiency. Example calculations: H2S Concentration = 0.5 ppm Gas Volume Flared = 572,000 scf Mass Emission =((Flared Volume)(H2S Fraction)/(H2S Ideal Gas Density))(MW SO2/MW H2S) =(572,000 scf)(.5ppm/1,000,000)/(11.14 lb/scf)((64.07lb SO2 /lb-mole)/(34.08 lb H2S /lb-mole)) = 0.05 lb SO2 = 276.19 lb",08/29/2017 11:01AM,08/29/2017 9:01PM,"FROM STANTON, TEXAS: FOLLOW I-20 WEST FOR APPROXIMATELY 5.5 MILES, THEN HEAD NORTH ON COUNTY ROAD 3001/FM829.

The cryogenic process was warmed up as much as possible while still meeting residue sales specification such that as much inlet gas as possible could be processed. Inlet gas will be shut in as quickly as safely possible to reduce flared volumes.,"The Midkiff Gas Plant received a curtailment of NGL sales. The curtailment was received due to fractionator plants being shut down in Houston due to Hurricane Harvey. This resulted in the inability to process all the inlet gas currently being directed to the plant. This routed inlet gas to the B-Plant flare, B Flare, to protect gathering system from being over pressured.","MIDKIFF, REAGAN","Step 1: For each gas component, calculate Net Molecular Weight (MW): Net MW (lb/lb-mole) =Mole % of Component/100 x MW of Component Example using propane: Net MW = 8.7522/100 x 44.10 lb/lb-mole = 3.86 lb/lb-mole Step 2: Calculate the Mass of Each Gas Component Emitted Mass of Component = (Net MW of Component/Molar Volume) x Volume Emitted Molar Volume = 379.5 scf/lb-mole Volume Emitted = Recorded Data From Flow Meter Or Calculated in the Case of Pipeline Releases as Follows: Cross-Sectional Area x Length x (Pipeline Pressure + Atmospheric Pressure)/Atmospheric Pressure Example using propane and recorded data: Volume emitted = 572,000 scf Mass of Propane Emitted = (3.86 lb/lb-mole)/(379.5 scf/lb-mole) x 572,000 scf = 5,818 lb Example using propane and calculated area: Pipe Diameter,d = 12 inches Pipe Length, l = 165,470 feet Pipe Pressure, ppipe = 50 psig Atmospheric Pressure, patmos = 14.70 psia Volume = (Pi)(d2/4)(l)(( ppipe + patmos)/ patmos) = (3.141592)((12/12)^2/4))(165,470)((50 + 14.7)/14.7) = 572,000 scf Mass of Propane Emitted = (3.86 lb/lb-mole)/(379.5 scf/lb-mole) x 572,000 scf = 5,818 lb For venting episodes, this calculation is repeated for each gas component and the mass emission rate is transferred automatically to the U/M Form. Proceed to Step 3 for flaring episodes. Step 3: For flaring episodes, 98 percent destruction efficiency is used for Calculation of VOC emissions. Products of combustion are calculated in Steps 4 and 5. Example using propane: Mass of Propane Emitted = (1 - 0.98)(5,818 lb) = 116.36 lb This calculation is repeated for each gas component and the emission rate is transferred automatically to the U/M Form. Step 4: Calculate NOx and CO Emissions from Combustion. Products of combustion, namely NOx and CO are calculated using AP-42 emission factors for flares. Specifically, the factors are taken from AP-42 Table 13.5-1, 4/15. Example calculations: NOx Factor = 0.138 lb/mmbtu CO Factor = 0.2755 lb/mmbtu Lower Heat Value of Gas = 1305 btu/scf (obtained from gas analysis) Mass Emission, lb = AP-42 Factor x LHV x Flared Volume NOx Emission = 0.138 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 103.01 lb CO Emission = 0.2755 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 360.09 lb Step 5: Calculate SO2 Emissions from Combustion. SO2 emissions are calculated based on the H2S concentration in the gas stream to be flared. Assumes 100 percent conversion of H2S to SO2. Western’s facilities are all in sweet gas service, therefore, H2S emissions are negligible for any assumed destruction efficiency. Example calculations: H2S Concentration = 0.5 ppm Gas Volume Flared = 572,000 scf Mass Emission =((Flared Volume)(H2S Fraction)/(H2S Ideal Gas Density))(MW SO2/MW H2S) =(572,000 scf)(.5ppm/1,000,000)/(11.14 lb/scf)((64.07lb SO2 /lb-mole)/(34.08 lb H2S /lb-mole)) = 0.05 lb SO2 = 276.19 lb",08/30/2017 12:11AM,08/30/2017 3:00PM,FROM FM 3095 AND FM 2401 IN MIDKIFF E 4.25 MI ON FM 2401 TO PLANT ENTRANCE,RN100215714,MIDKIFF GAS PLANT,INITIAL REPORT,EMISSIONS EVENT,266557

Power was restored and INVISTA is in the process of restoring other systems and evaluating the impact from the Hurricane with available limited resources. Both flares were operating properly during the venting period. The venting to the Startup Flare stopped once the west converters were completely shut down and the venting to the Ammonia Flare ceased once the west ammonia train pressure decreased and stabilized. The west ammonia train was not shut down as the shutdown and startup emissions are higher than the emissions from running the West ammonia train. The spill was contained within the building.,"This is for documentation purpose only as regulation 30 TAC 101 is suspended due to hurricane Harvey through the Governor's proclamation. As a result of hurricane Harvey, ADN unit lost power and as a result, HCN west converters were shut down and vented to the Startup Flare per procedure. Due to the shutdown of the west train converters, excess amount of ammonia in the west ammonia train vented to the Ammonia Flare per procedure. Additionally, organics spilled into the building containment from the Organic Receiver because of the effects of the power outage on equipment and systems.","ORANGE, ORANGE","Process data, process knowledge and emission estimates.",08/30/2017 4:22AM,08/30/2017 1:47PM,,RN104392626,INVISTA SARL SABINE RIVER SITE,INITIAL REPORT,EMISSIONS EVENT,266565
